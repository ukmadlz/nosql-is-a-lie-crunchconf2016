#  Graph Datastores

note:
- Graph DBMS, also called graph-oriented DBMS or graph database, represent data in graph structures as nodes and edges, which are relationships between nodes. They allow easy processing of data in that form, and simple calculation of specific properties of the graph, such as the number of steps needed to get from one node to another node.
- Graph DBMSs usually don't provide indexes on all nodes, direct access to nodes based on attribute values is not possible in these cases.
