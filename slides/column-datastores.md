#  Column Datastores

note:
- Wide Column Datastores
- Wide column stores, also called extensible record stores, store data in records with an ability to hold very large numbers of dynamic columns. Since the column names as well as the record keys are not fixed, and since a record can have billions of columns, wide column stores can be seen as two-dimensional key-value stores.
- Wide column stores share the chracteristic of being schema-free with document stores, however the implementation is very different.
